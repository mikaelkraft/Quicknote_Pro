Per request from @mikaelkraft: I will keep pushing incremental commits to this PR and won’t cut test builds. Below is the working plan and tracking checklist; I’ll check items off as they land.

Defaults in use
- KDF: Argon2id (PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 fallback)
- Export selected: templates excluded by default (toggle available)
- Remember password: stored via OS Keystore/Keychain when enabled

Encrypted backups
- [ ] AES-GCM encryption for backup payloads with random nonce per archive
- [ ] Password prompt UI with optional “remember on device”
- [ ] Argon2id key derivation with salt; PBKDF2 fallback
- [ ] Backward-compatible import for unencrypted ZIPs
- [ ] Robust error handling and user-facing messages
- [ ] Documentation updates (README)

Export selected
- [ ] Multi-select toolbar action to export selected notes
- [ ] Note overflow menu action (single-note export)
- [ ] Option to include templates (default off)
- [ ] ZIP layout parity with full export (notes.json + media/)
- [ ] Tests

Import improvements
- [ ] Dry-run validation with per-item details
- [ ] Clearer conflict summary and resolution UX
- [ ] Better missing-media handling (warnings, optional skip)
- [ ] Merge strategy confirmation
- [ ] Tests

UI polish
- [ ] Progress with cancel
- [ ] Error states (banners/dialogs)
- [ ] Post-import sync prompt

Tests
- [ ] Services unit tests (backup/import, crypto)
- [ ] Basic UI flows
- [ ] Crypto edge cases

Misc
- [ ] README updates for new options
- [ ] Changelog entry (if applicable)

I’ll continue committing in small slices and will update this comment as items complete. No test builds will be cut until you ask otherwise.
