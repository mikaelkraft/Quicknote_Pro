   - File metadata display (size, creation date)
   - Delete functionality with confirmation dialog

3. **Extended Data Models**
   - Added `audio` type to `AttachmentType` enum
   - Added `durationSeconds` field to `Attachment` model
   - Added `formattedDuration` getter for user-friendly time display
   - Extended `Note` model with `audioAttachments` getter

4. **Service Layer Integration**

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Audio Recording
- Uses `record` package for cross-platform audio recording
- AAC format (.m4a) for mobile platforms for optimal compression
- WAV format for web platform compatibility
- Proper microphone permission handling per platform

#### Audio Playback
- Uses `audioplayers` package for reliable audio playback
- Seek functionality with visual progress indication
- Platform-specific file path handling

#### Permission Handling
- Microphone permissions with graceful denial handling
- Platform-specific permission request flow
- Settings redirect for denied permissions

#### Premium Feature Gating
- Free users: 5-minute recording limit
- Premium users: 30-minute recording limit
- Upgrade prompts for limit exceeded scenarios
- Visual indicators for premium features

#### Data Persistence
- Audio files stored in app documents directory
- Metadata stored in note attachments array
- Integration with existing backup/restore system

### Testing Coverage

Comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Attachment model with audio type
- Duration formatting and validation
- Note model with audio attachment filtering
- Service layer audio operations
- Serialization/deserialization of audio attachments

```

### Cross-Platform Considerations

#### Android
- Requires RECORD_AUDIO permission in AndroidManifest.xml
- Uses AAC encoder for optimal file size
- Handles runtime permission requests

#### iOS
- Requires NSMicrophoneUsageDescription in Info.plist
- Native AAC support through AVAudioRecorder
- Automatic permission prompts

#### Web
- Uses MediaRecorder API
- Falls back to WAV format
- Browser-specific permission handling

### Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

1. **Premium Features**
   - Voice-to-text transcription
   - Audio search functionality
   - Background recording capability
   - Cloud backup for audio files

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Audio waveform visualization during playback
   - Audio editing (trim, merge)
   - Multiple audio format support
   - Batch operations on audio files

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Audio compression options
   - Background processing
   - Efficient storage management
   - Audio file cleanup

### Installation and Usage

1. The `audioplayers` dependency has been added to `pubspec.yaml`
2. Permission handling is built into the widgets
3. The voice note button appears in the note editor floating action menu
4. Recorded audio appears as playable attachments in the note content

This implementation provides a solid foundation for voice note functionality while maintaining the app's existing architecture and user experience patterns.
