# Pricing Tiers and Monetization Strategy

This document defines the pricing structure, feature limitations, and upgrade paths for Quicknote Pro.

> üìù Note on Localization: As of version 1.1.0, all pricing tier names, billing periods, and key feature descriptions are now localized. See [docs/localization.md](localization.md) for details on supported languages and localization keys.

## Overview

Quicknote Pro uses a freemium model with four tiers: Free, Premium, Pro, and Enterprise. Each tier provides increasing value through expanded feature access and higher usage limits.

## Pricing Structure

### Base Market Pricing (USD)

| Tier        | Monthly         | Annual (status) | Lifetime |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Free        | $0              | -               | -        |
| Premium     | $0.99           | ‚Äî (hidden)      | $9.99    |
| Pro         | $1.99           | ‚Äî (hidden)      | $19.99   |
| Enterprise  | $4.99/user      | ‚Äî (hidden)      | -        |

Notes
- Annual plans are currently hidden (reserved for future experimentation with an expected ~20% savings framing).
- Lifetime is available for Premium and Pro only.
- Enterprise is priced per user/month and includes advanced team/security features.
- Prices shown in-app use localized currency symbols; amounts are anchored to USD.

### Regional Pricing

- Paused for now. Current base pricing ($0.99‚Äì$1.99) reduces the need for regional adjustments.
- Keep analytics support for region to inform potential future rollouts.
- The app defaults to base pricing with localized currency formatting where supported.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Usage Tracking
```dart
// Check feature availability (includes trial access)
final canUseFeature = monetizationService.canUseFeature(FeatureType.voiceNoteRecording);

// Record feature usage
await monetizationService.recordFeatureUsage(FeatureType.voiceNoteRecording);

// Check remaining usage
final remaining = monetizationService.getRemainingUsage(FeatureType.voiceNoteRecording);

// Access retention services
final referralCode = await monetizationService.referralService.generateReferralCode(userId: 'user123');
final availableCoupons = monetizationService.couponService.getApplicableCoupons(
  currentTier: UserTier.free,
  targetTier: UserTier.premium,
  term: PlanTerm.monthly,
  userId: 'user123',
);
final trialOffered = await monetizationService.trialService.startTrial(
  TrialConfig(tier: UserTier.premium, durationDays: 7),
);
```

### Upgrade Prompts
```dart
// Check if upgrade prompt should be shown (considers trial access)
final shouldShow = monetizationService.shouldShowUpgradePrompt(
  FeatureType.advancedDrawing,
  context: 'drawing_tool_selection'
);

if (shouldShow) {
  // Show contextual upgrade prompt with trial offer
  showUpgradePrompt(FeatureType.advancedDrawing);

  // Record prompt shown
  await monetizationService.recordUpgradePromptShown();
}

// Start trial instead of immediate upgrade
final trialConfig = TrialConfig(
  tier: UserTier.premium,
  durationDays: 7,
  type: TrialType.standard,
);
await monetizationService.trialService.startTrial(trialConfig);
```

### Feature Gating
```dart
// Gate premium features (with trial support)
Widget buildDrawingTool(DrawingTool tool) {
  final isAvailable = monetizationService.isFeatureAvailable(
    FeatureType.advancedDrawing
  );

  return GestureDetector(
    onTap: isAvailable ? () => selectTool(tool) : () => showUpgradeOrTrialPrompt(),
    child: Opacity(
      opacity: isAvailable ? 1.0 : 0.5,
      child: Stack(
        children: [
          DrawingToolIcon(tool),
          if (!isAvailable && !monetizationService.hasActiveTrial)
            Positioned(
              top: 0,
              right: 0,
              child: TrialBadge(
                onTap: () => startTrial(UserTier.premium),
              ),
            ),
        ],
      ),
    ),
