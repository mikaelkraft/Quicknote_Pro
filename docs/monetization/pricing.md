## Feature Limits and Restrictions

## 📁 User-Managed Cloud Storage Strategy

**Sustainable and flexible storage approach:**
- **Free Tier**: Local storage and file system access only - users save/import from device storage
- **Paid Tiers**: Cloud sync capabilities enabled - storage managed by user's cloud provider (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, etc.)
- **No Storage Promises**: App handles sync possibility, not storage limits - removes infrastructure costs and scaling concerns
- **User Control**: Storage limits determined by user's existing cloud service subscriptions

This approach eliminates the need for the app to promise specific storage amounts while providing powerful cloud sync capabilities for paid users.
