Acknowledged prefs and proceeding:
- Pickers: image_picker for camera/gallery, file_picker for arbitrary files.
- State wiring: Local controller within a StatefulWidget (no provider/riverpod). Can refactor to an InheritedWidget later if needed.
- Android permissions: gate at runtime by SDK level — SDK >= 33 request READ_MEDIA_IMAGES for gallery access; below 33 request READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE. Request CAMERA as needed for capture. Manifest remains minimal and aligned with minSdk/target.

Implementation notes:
- Debounced autosave (~700ms) on title/content.
- Attachment thumbnails for images; file name + size for others; delete affordance.
- Graceful handling for permission denial with retry snackbars.
- Tests: controller autosave + attachment ops; widget autosave persistence with SharedPreferences mock.

I’ll push commits to this PR accordingly and update the description to close #1 when ready. If you want a different debounce window or UI affordances, let me know here.
